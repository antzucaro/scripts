A bunch of scripts that I find useful in common workflows:

flac2mp3 - convert FLACs to MP3
gpsdiff - distance between two latitude/longitude pairs
gpx2csv - turns a GPX (GPS related) file into latitude/longitude pairs
llld - list the directories in a given path that have no directories within them (list leaf level directories)
m3u - create m3u playlists in a given directory by examining IDv3 tags
pk3_print_emails - prints the maps and e-mail addresses found in Quake3/Nexuiz map pk3s
print_gallery.py - quick and dirty html output for my Wordpress image galleries
raw2jpg - use ufraw-batch to convert raw files from my Nikon D70 into jpgs for web use
rename_directories - one-time conversion script to go from <descriptor><YYYYMMDD> to <YYYYMMDD><descriptor>
rename_images - take images in a directory and rename them with a prefix and an incrementing number
rmrawdupes - remove raw files in a given directory if I've already converted them to jpg
thumbnail - make a square thumbnail that shrinks the image and crops the excess
trspaces - remove or escape stuff when doing bash processing with find or xargs
